## TODO:

- Choose a GUI library: Pick a Python GUI library, such as Tkinter or PyQt5, for creating the desktop interface.
- Design the interface: Design the main window, which should include input fields for expense details, buttons for adding/editing/deleting expenses, and an area to display the list of expenses.
- Implement the backend: Create functions to handle the addition, editing, and deletion of expenses. You can store the expenses data in a file or a local database.
- Implement data visualization: Use a library like Matplotlib or Plotly to create charts for visualizing the expenses data.
- Package the application: Package the application into a standalone executable using a tool like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze.
